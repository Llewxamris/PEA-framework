# 11. Training
Users will be trained to use our system via a centralized help page on the
application. This help page includes step-by-step instructions for all flows
as well as images.
This help page is organized alphabetically, as is grouped by instructions for
Candidates and for RAC Advisors. Non-RAC Advisors cannot see the help for
RAC Advisors.
Some pages, such as the registration pages, contains
helpful instructions within the page itself. A video tutorial is also available,
which lets users watch the developers use the system while describing what
they are doing on the screen.

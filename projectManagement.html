<p>The initial estimate of the of the project was created after an initial meeting
with our client. We broke down their requests into several user stories to be
used as a guideline into building our backlog items for TFS.</p>

<p>These backlog items were places into either our product backlog, or our first
sprint backlog. The product backlog represents all work items that need to be
completed before the system is considered completed. Related, the sprint
backlog contains all the work items needed to be completed before the related sprint
is completed. The sprint backlog is created with the client, allowing us to
prioritize which backlog items we work on for a sprint. This allows us to easily
filter what work should be done for each sprint.</p>

<p>This sprint backlog was created during the sprint planning meeting. As
mentioned above, this allows the team members to prioritize work items based on
the users needs. A second portion of the meeting would be the task sizing
meeting, in where we break down the backlog items into smaller tasks that are
more atomic, more specific.</p>

<p><a href="./files/mHaley_E42_PEA_A04.xlsx">Example Product Backlog</a></p>

<p>After the tasks has been fleshed out, development starts. We tracked out
development using the provided burndown chart. This chart shows how much work
is remaining (y-axis), and how much time is remaining in the sprint (x-axis).
A burndown chart can be used to determine how well we are completing this
sprint. A chart that is linear, and negative is the goal. Too many peaks, and
valleys means that the sizing of tasks was not done properly, etc.</p>

<p>All hour reporting was done through TFS. This keeps the burndown chart
up-to-date, and gives the team a centralized location to see their own progress
as well as the progress of the team. TFS is built into our development
environment, as well as <em>Visual Studio</em>, our IDE. TFS also is set-up to follow
the <em>scrum</em> methodology, which meant very little tweaking was needed for it to
meet our needs. These reasons made using TFS over other source-code control
tools an obvious choice.</p>

<p><a href="./files/mHaley_E42_A04_Sprint1.png">Example Sprint Burndown Chart</a></p>

<p>Another form of status reporting were scrum meetings. Scrum meetings took place
before work periods. The purpose of scrum meetings were to the team members
each other up-to-date to each others statuses. Each team member would answer
three questions: “What did you do yesterday?”, “What will you do today?”, and
“Is there anything blocking your progress?”. This keeps communication with the
team up-to-date, and lets the team notice any possible weak points in the
system, or with the sprint planning. The only issue we had at first was
recording team members answers, which made it hard to follow up on commitments.
This was solved by introducing a spreadsheet that was updated during every
sprint meeting.</p></div>

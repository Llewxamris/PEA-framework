# Maxwell Haley --- Program Exist Assessment

## Colour Rational
Colours chosen are white, gray, and the primary default colour from the Bulma
framework. These colours were chosen because they are simple, professional, 
while still splashing a touch of colour to the page.

## Banner Rational
The banner is a very simple SVG of the letters P, E, A. Since it has to fit
snugly inside the navbar, I wanted something simple and legible at small sizes.

## CSS3 Elements
The mug-shot image uses both the CSS animations, and rounded borders. The
framework also makes works of flexboxes.

## Tools

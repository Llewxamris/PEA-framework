# 1. Introduction
This website is a Program Exit Assessment (PEA) written by Maxwell Haley for
the Computer Science Program of Cégep Heritage College. The goal of the PEA is
to demonstrate the fulfillment of objectives for the Computer Science Program,
and integrating all learned skills within the program. Navigating around this
site is simple.

experience.

The subject of the portfolio is the Recognition of Acquired Competencies (RAC)
web application. It is a full stack application built by myself, and five other
team members, made for the College itself. It allows individuals interested in
pursuing a diploma the ability to substitute previous schooling/work experience
for credits towards their diploma. It also allows administrators to manage RAC
requests, send requests to content specialist to determine if a candidate is
qualified for substitution, and other such administrative tasks. This project
was built between November 2017, and May 2018.

# 14. Applied Experience
In order to be eligible for the co-op program for Computer Science, one must
have:

- Completed all first, and second semester program specific courses
- Completed at least one English course
- Have a 70% average
- Maintain the academic standards in all courses

The co-op program gives students access to summer employment inside the field
of Computer Science. This gives student’s valuable workplace experience, an
opportunity to make money over the summer, and most importantly connections
with those in the industry.

The first co-op experience was with the Employment and Social Development
Canada branch of the Government of Canada. I was a systems engineer working on
the Oracle DSB, helping migrate the system to a newer version, mapping out the
network, moving the teams source controls from Subversion to Git, and deploying
patches to our various server verticals. This co-op term lasted from May 2016
to August 2016.

 The second co-op experience was also with ESDC. This time, I worked as a
junior software developer. There, I worked on the Common System for Grants and
Contributions. I worked on the reporting software, fixing bugs with the
generated PDFs, as well as fixing bugs in the web application. This co-op term
lasted from April 2017 to August 2017.

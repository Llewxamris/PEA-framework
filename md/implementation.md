# 8. Implementation

A workflow I worked on was uploading documents to the system. Mostly on the
Candidates side, but code was reused for the RAC Advisor side as well. From a
Users perspective, the flow involves being able to upload documents to our
system, download them back from the system, and removing files from the system.

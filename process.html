<p>The development methodology chosen to develop the RAC application for Heritage
College is Agile using the Scrum framework. Agile is a development
approach that focuses on communicating within the development teams as well as
incorporating the customer into the development cycle. It is adaptive, allowing
the development team to react to changes to the customer’s vision of the
product. This prevents miscommunication, a lack of understanding of business
needs, or simply a change in the customers’ needs from delaying the project. An
Agile approach works these changes into the system without slowing the
flow of development.</p>

<p>Agile is based on these four values:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Individuals and Interactions</strong> over processes and tools</li><li><strong>Working Software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</li><li><strong>Customer Collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</li><li><strong>Responding to Change</strong> over following a plan</li></ul>

<p>Teams should be focusing on the following concepts:</p>

<ul><li>Collaborating well, rather than being loaded with workflows to keep them on
check.</li><li>Demonstrating a working product, rather than a mound of documentation that can
easily become obsolete.</li><li>Including the customer as part of the development process, rather than wait
until the software is finished before receiving feedback. </li><li>Reacting to changes as they are requested, rather than blocking out a very
specific plan.</li></ul>

<p>Scrum is a framework for agile development that focuses on iterative design
cycles, and constant inner-team/team-to-customer communication. Scrum begins
with gathering user stories, and acceptance criteria. User stories are a
feature requested by the customer, that is captured by the development team.
It is captured in a format that is easily understood, but contains enough
information to be able to develop off of. The format is typically:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"As an {actor}, I want {some feature}, so that {reason for the feature}.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p>User stories allow the development team to easily break user requirements down
into smaller tasks. It also ensures that the development team has understood
clearly the requirements given by the customer.</p>

<p>Acceptance criteria are a tool used to define when a piece of functionality is
considered “finished”. A typical term used is definition of done. How does one
know when a piece of functionality is completed? Acceptance criteria usually
follow a format similar to user stories, and are based off of the user stories
themselves.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“Given {a condition/trigger}, when I {an action},
then I {expect a result}.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p>By following acceptance criteria, and confirming it with the clients, the
development team knows exactly what is expected in the finished system.</p>

<p>Scrum uses an iterative design cycle, called Sprints. A sprint consists of
around two week periods of development. First, the customer gives priority to
functionality items. Then, the developers break down the tasks, and complete
them in order of priority. During the two-week period, the team has a daily
meeting, called a daily scrum, to keep each other up to date on tasks
completion. Each team member says what they have been working on, what they
will be working on, and any issues they have in completing their task. By the
end of the period, the team presents their updated version of the system to the
customer. Then, the cycle continuous, until the product is completed.</p>

<p>Agile Scrum was an appropriate choice for the RAC project. The team only had a
period of roughly seven months to develop the system, so an iterative, low
overhead approach was needed. Having the customer available more often meant
that the customer could dynamically change the features they needed, which came
in handy when there was miscommunication. The constant team communication also
meant those who became stuck, or who needed some guidance always had a support
line. A disadvantage with this methodology was the short sprint cycles. Two weeks
meant that the team had to juggle testing thoroughly, with being able to
demonstrate functionality. However, this simply required the team to better
manage its time, which resulted in a better system overall.</p></div>

# 3. Working Environment

The work environment for our development project was entirely the _Microsoft_
workflow for teams. That is: _Visual Studios_ for development, and _Team
Foundation Server_ (TFS) for source control and task tracking. Important 
documentation was shared originally with _Google Drive_, but we moved to using 
the internal shared drive used by the college. The team of consisted of six team
members: _Andrew_, _Brae_, _Cody_, _Louis_, _Phillip_, and myself. Our project 
manager was our teacher, _Richard Chan_, our technical advisor was another teacher,
_Allan McDonald_, and our client was _Alain Beauparlant_. Six members was chosen
because it both means the team is large-enough (too many/little members would cause
issues), and also because it divides perfectly into the total amount of class
members. Roles were not officially assigned to each team member, but most
members gravitated towards one specific module of the application.

My experience with the team environment was excellent. Interacting with the
team itself was a pleasure, each team member completed their individual tasks
on time, and there were very few moments of team members stepping on each
others toes. An issue with team dynamics were team member not updating their
tasks on TFS. This would lead to tasks marked as _To Do_ actually being _Done_,
or tasks with no one assigned to them actually having a member working on it.
This was somewhat related to another issue with the team, which was communication.
At first, communication during non-class work time was scarce, which lead to
overstepping work, merge issues, and expectations not being met. The last issue
was individual programmer preference. Source code styling differed between
developers, as well as what conventions/patterns were appropriate for solving
an issue. This was solved by introducing a coding convention document for the
team. This eliminated personal preference from the equation, homogenizing our
system. The tooling was fine to work with, when it worked. Team Foundation Server had a
few issues, where it auto-resolving conflicts lead to missing files, and
lines-of-code.

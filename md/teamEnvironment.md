# 3. Working Environment

The work environment for our development project was entirely the _Microsoft_
workflow for teams. That is: _Visual Studios_ for development, and _Team
Foundation Server_ for source control. Important documentation was shared
originally with _Google Drive_, but we moved to using the internal shared drive
used by the college. The team of consisted of six team members: _Andrew_,
_Brae_, _Cody_, _Louis_, _Phillip_, and myself. Six members was chosen because
it both means the team is large-enough (too many/little members would cause
issues), and also because it divides perfectly into the total amount of class
members. Roles were not officially assigned to each team member, but most
members gravitated towards one specific module of the application.

My experience with the team environment was excellent. Interacting with the
team itself was a pleasure, each team member completed their individual tasks
on time, and there were very few moments of team members stepping on each
others toes. An issue with team dynamics were team member not updating their
tasks on TFS. This would lead to tasks marked as _To Do_ actually being _Done_,
or tasks with no one assigned to them actually having a member working on it.
The tooling was fine to work with, when it worked. Team Foundation Server had a
few issues, where it auto-resolving conflicts lead to missing files, and
lines-of-code.

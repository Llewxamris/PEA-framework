# 13. Communication

## Research Project
Systems IV had students write and present their research on a topic relevant
to the future of the Computer Science program. My topic was the programming
language Kotlin, specifically for Android application development. Research
involved diving deep into experienced developer experiences with the Kotlin
language. My recommendation was not to use the Kotlin programming language for
Android development until Kotlin becomes a driving force in the Android realm.

## French Translation
During the Computer Science program, we had to take two French courses. French
is important to know in the Outaouais region, as it is bilingual with English
being the other official language. Not knowing French means not being able to
easily communicate with the majority of people living in the Outaouais.

The translated text is the _System Overview_. This is displayed in the _About_
page of the system. The _System Overview_ is a description
of the system from a high-level point of view. This is for new users who
are looking for an explanation of what the system does and what role it
fulfills. It has been translated to French to demonstrate my competency in
utilizing the French language.
